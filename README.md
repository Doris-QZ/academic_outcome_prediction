#### Supervised Learning Final Project

**Description:** This is the final project for the Supervised Learning course in the MS Data Science program at the University of Colorado Boulder. The goal of this project is to build a supervised classification model to predict student dropouts and identify which students need additional support to prevent them from dropping out.

**Dataset:** The dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention/data), contains 4,424 records with 35 attributes, each representing an individual student.
